# Text Technologies

This repository contains my coursework for the 5th Year [Text Technologies](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/tts/) course, taken in 2012/2013. There were four short pieces of coursework for the TTS course, each involving implementing a course-related concept:

    1. Web Crawling
    2. Keyword-based Image Search
    3. Duplicate Detection
    4. PageRank and HITS

Coursework for other courses can be found in my main [University Coursework](https://github.com/stephenmcgruer/University) repository.

There are some small errors in at least the first two courseworks; particularly, the marker and I disagreed about the first coursework and whether my implementation was correct (original mark: 73%).
